# House_Sales_Dashboard
In today's dynamic real estate market, having access to comprehensive data is crucial for making informed decisions. That's why I developed this interactive dashboard to provide insights into house sales trends, patterns, and performance metrics.

Key features of the House Sales Dashboard include:

-- Sales Overview: Get a snapshot of total sales, average prices, and total revenue over a customizable period.

-- Geospatial Visualization: Explore house sales geographically with an interactive mapâ€”filter by location, property type, or price range to pinpoint opportunities.

-- Time-Series Analysis: Track sales trends over time, enabling you to identify seasonal fluctuations, and market trends, and forecast future performance.

-- Demographic Insights: Understand your target market better by integrating demographic data. Analyze buyer profiles based on age, income, and other factors.

-- Performance Metrics: Measure the effectiveness of your sales efforts with metrics like conversion rates, days on the market, and average selling price.

This project not only showcases my proficiency in data visualization but also highlights the power of Tableau in transforming raw data into actionable insights. Whether you're a real estate agent, investor, or industry professional, this dashboard empowers you to make data-driven decisions and stay ahead in the competitive market.
